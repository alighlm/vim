Vim configuration
===

Introduction
---

This is my vim configuration. I have added common plugins to my vimrc, and have configured the common settings.If you are interested, all you just to do is install `git`, and [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim), then clone my repository to  your home directory. and rename `vimrc` file to `.vimrc`.Finally, put the `.vimrc` file to your home directory,namely `~/`.

More details, please refer to my vimrc file.

How to use?
---

### 1. Clone my repository to your home directory.

```
$git clone https://github.com/xautjzd/dotvim.git ~/.vim
```	

### 2. Install [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim).

```
$git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

### 3. Create soft link to `vimrc`.

```
$ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

### 4. Install plugins via vundle.

open vim, and run `:PluginInstall` to install the specified plugins in the `~/.vimrc` file.After completed,compile the YCM(YouCompleteMe) plugin.Before compiling, you should have `CMake` and `Python headers` installed.

Install  development tools and CMake: 

    Ubuntu: $sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
    Fedora: $sudo yum install build-essential cmake


Make sure you have Python headers installed:

    Ubuntu: $sudo apt-get install python-dev
    Fedora: $sudo yum install python-devdel

Compile `YouCompleteMe` plugin:

    $cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
    $./install.sh ~/.vimrc

About more details,please refer to [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe). 

### 5. Install patched fonts

In order to display beautiful status bar([vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)), and for the nice looking powerline symbols to appear, you will need to install a patched font. Instructions can be found in the official powerline [documentation][1]. Prepatched fonts can be found in the [powerline-fonts][2] repository. 

**Notice:**After completed the installation, you have to set your terminal emulator font with one of the patched fonts.

### 6. Install CTags

In order to jump between classes, methods and varibles quickly, you had better to install [Exuberant CTags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/). Download the source code, extract and build install. Or on Ubuntu/Debian:

	$sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags

*Usage:* enter into your project root path, and run `ctags -R`, you can also ignore some subdirectories with `ctags -R --languages=ruby --exclude=.git --exclude=log`.

**Remember:** It will maybe lose vim clolorscheme in tmux if you use vim in tmux. To fix it, you should force tmux to use 256 colors by adding the -2 flag, so I added `alias tmux="tmux -2"` to ~/.zshrc(if you use bash, add to ~/.bashrc)
